      + tickit_later            => tickit_watch_later
      + tickit_timer_cancel     => tickit_watch_cancel
  * Added toplevel Tickit functions for loop control
      + tickit_tick(3)
      + tickit_watch_io_read(3)
      + tickit_watch_timer_at_epoch(3)
      + tickit_watch_timer_at_tv(3)
  * Added TickitType
      + tickit_term_ctltype(3)
  * Added window controls
      + tickit_window_getctl_int(3)
      + tickit_window_setctl_int(3)
      + tickit_window_ctlname(3)
      + tickit_window_lookup_ctl(3)
      + tickit_window_ctltype(3)
  * Added toplevel Tickit instance controls
      + tickit_getctl_int(3)
      + tickit_setctl_int(3)
      + tickit_ctlname(3)
      + tickit_lookup_ctl(3)
      + tickit_ctltype(3)
  * TICKIT_PEN_UNDER type is now integer, supports single, double, wavy underline
  * Fixed various example/demo-*.c files so they work again
  * Added experimental new ability to provide event loop hooks for other event
    loops
  * Deleted the deprecated tickit_string_* functions that were renamed to
    tickit_utf8_*
  * Renumbered TICKIT_PEN_* constants to start from 1; lists can end with 0
  * Use termios to know what backspace (VERASE) character is, rather than
    relying on terminfo - experience from vim, neovim, etc.. is that this is
    often more reliable
  * tickit_watch_* callbacks now receive an info pointer, to match the calling
    style of other object bindings
