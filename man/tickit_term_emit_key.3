.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtickit_term_emit_key\fP() invokes the event handler chain on the terminal instance, as if a key event had been received from the controlling terminal.\fBtickit_term_emit_mouse\fP() invokes the event handler chain on the terminal instance, as if a mouse event had been received from the controlling terminal.
